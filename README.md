###Build a simple Monopoly game

Building a Monopoly game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great project for improving your skills in web development. Here is a basic outline for building a Monopoly game:

Create the board:

Use HTML and CSS to create the layout of the Monopoly board. You can create squares for each property and color them according to the corresponding Monopoly property groups (e.g. brown, light blue, etc.).
Design the game pieces:

Use HTML and CSS to create game pieces that players can use to move around the board. You can use simple shapes such as circles or squares, or you can get creative and design more complex game pieces.
Create the dice:

Use JavaScript to randomly generate a number between 1 and 6 when a player rolls the dice. You can use this number to determine how many spaces a player moves on the board.
Implement player movement:

Use JavaScript to update the position of the game piece on the board each time a player rolls the dice. You can use a simple switch statement or an array to keep track of the player's position.
Implement property buying and trading:

Use JavaScript to allow players to buy and trade properties on the board. You can use an object to store information about each property, such as its name, price, and owner. You can also implement a trading system where players can negotiate with each other to buy and sell properties.
Implement rent and mortgages:

Use JavaScript to calculate and collect rent from players who land on properties owned by other players. You can also implement a mortgage system where players can mortgage their properties to raise money.
Implement winning and losing:

Use JavaScript to determine when a player has won or lost the game. A player can win by acquiring all properties on the board or by forcing all other players to go bankrupt. A player can lose by going bankrupt or by failing to acquire the necessary properties to win the game.
This is a basic outline for building a Monopoly game. You can add more features and complexity as you become more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Good luck with your project!
